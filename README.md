Welcome to my GitHub page!

Throughout my career, I've developed software for private companies that restricted me from sharing my work publicly. As a result, the repositories you'll find here are either forks I've contributed to or modified for my personal use.

In the near future, I intend to share some utilities I've relied on for years to handle everyday tasks. I hope you’ll find them helpful.

Right now, I’m focused on learning about generative AI and prompt engineering, exploring how to practically and effectively apply these skills to general software development, with a particular interest in DevOps applications.
